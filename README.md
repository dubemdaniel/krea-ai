This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app, inspired by Krea AI, a cutting-edge platform launched in 2023 for real-time AI-driven image and video generation powered by models like FLUX.1. My project replicates Krea’s sleek, user-focused homepage design for a seamless creative experience.

Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result—a responsive homepage built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, mirroring Krea AI’s clean aesthetic.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Geist, a new font family for Vercel.

Project Overview

This open-source clone focuses on:





Responsive Homepage: Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript for a modern, type-safe frontend.



UI Design: Mirrors Krea’s clean aesthetic with a dynamic hero section, showcasing AI-generated art concepts and a prompt input field (mocked for now).



Performance: Leverages Next.js for fast server-side rendering and Tailwind for rapid, responsive styling.

View the live demo at https://krea-ai-five.vercel.app/ to explore the homepage—designed to feel like Krea’s inviting entry point for creatives. This project sharpened my skills in modern web development and UI design. Eager to bring this expertise to your team
